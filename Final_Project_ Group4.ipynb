Once the genre portion is done, we compute TdifVectorization along with Cosine similarity on the \"tag\" of filtered movies (\"tag\" is a combination of overview, keywords, production company, and other metadata). Lastly, the function adds a \"runtime\" filter, in the sense that we don't want to suggest movies that are either too short or too long compared to the inputted movie. The system then provides the recommendations. \n",

Second, the system will calculate and sort for vote average, which represents the overall \"liking\" or \"rating\" of the movie. Finally, the system shows the recommendations."
